## Geospatial Analysis for Agricultural Plots and Machinery Utilization - QGIS Plugin

### Project Overview

This project aims to leverage geospatial data collected from farmers' mobile devices to analyze agricultural plots and machinery utilization. The primary goal is to develop a QGIS plugin that seamlessly integrates the obtained data, including plot boundaries and machinery usage records, to provide valuable insights for informed decision-making in the agriculture sector.

### Project Features

1. **Plot Boundaries Processing:**
   - Implement algorithms to process plot boundaries data, enabling the calculation of total plot area and perimeter for each agricultural plot.
   - Utilize advanced geospatial analysis techniques to accurately determine the centroid of each plot.

2. **Visualization and Mapping:**
   - Visualize the plot boundaries and centroids on the map within the QGIS environment for enhanced understanding.
   - Enable users to interact with the map, displaying relevant information on demand.

3. **Machinery Utilization Analysis:**
   - Integrate machinery usage data obtained from farmers' mobile devices into the plugin.
   - Analyze the duration for which machinery is being used on each plot, facilitating insights into machinery utilization patterns.

4. **Aggregate Usage Data:**
   - Aggregate the machinery usage data to estimate the total machinery usage time for different plots.
   - Provide summary statistics and visualizations for better decision-making regarding machinery allocation and usage optimization.
